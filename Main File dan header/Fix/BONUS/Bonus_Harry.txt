IEEE ITB SB Motivational Essay
Harry Sangmahata Purba
Let's start with the beginning, shall we? Growing up, my family always moved because of my parent's job. From moving from continent to continent, science, technology, and engineering have always been my interest. In primary school to high school, I've joined Science Olympiads and many other competitions that involve STEM. Even in university, I've dabbled in a couple of organizations that involve STEM. But I digress. I've been following this path of STEM and wish to continue it. This is why I think IEEE is a great fit for me.
Working in teams has always been my strong suit. Back in primary school, the Science Olympiad was a team competition. The team was tasked with solving problems. From this, I'm trained in communicating in teams and working hard as a team. In high school and university, I've also joined many organizations that require teamwork.
IEEE ITB SB offers me many opportunities to grow with the focus of engineering. To me, IEEE is an organization that shares the same passion as me and a place for me to explore my skill set and improve upon these skills. Iâ€™ve chosen IEEE because it relates to my major and also my career. I feel like IEEE will be a sneak peek / head start in exploring my career life.
IEEE ITB SB can help me achieve my goals by creating events that allow me to work hard and train my skills in communicating and teamwork. My ultimate goal in joining an organization is to grow as a better person. Creating events will offer me opportunities to train and improve my skill set.
My expectations for IEEE ITB SB are to become a place for me to work with great people and grow as an individual to strive for greatness. In this organization, I hope to create a strong bond with people I work
